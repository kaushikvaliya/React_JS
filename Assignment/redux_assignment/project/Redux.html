            <h3>what is redux ?</h3>
            <p><span><b>Ans:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></span>Redux is an open-source JavaScript library used to manage application
                state. React uses Redux for building the user interface. </p>
            <p>React Redux is the official React binding for Redux. It allows React components to read data from a Redux
                Store, and dispatch Actions to the Store to update data. Redux helps apps to scale by providing a
                sensible way to manage state through a unidirectional data flow model. React Redux is conceptually
                simple. It subscribes to the Redux store, checks to see if the data which your component wants have
                changed, and re-renders your component.</p>

            <h3>What is Redux Thunk used for?</h3>
            <p><span><b>Ans:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></span>“Redux Thunk middleware allows you to write action creators that
                return a function instead of an action.” For me personally, it makes more sense to think of these thunk
                functions as services since they don't return actions. Remember that actions are plain objects. </p>

            <h3>What is Pure Component? When to use Pure Component over Component?</h3>
            <p><span><b>Ans:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></span>A React component is considered pure if it renders the same output
                for the same state and props. For this
                type of class component, React provides the <code><span >PureComponent</span></code> base class. Class
                components
                that extend the
                <code><span>React</span><span >.</span><span >PureComponent</span></code>
                class are treated as pure components.
            </p>

            <p>Pure components have some performance improvements and render optimizations since React implements
                the <code><span >shouldComponentUpdate</span><span>()</span></code>
                method for them with a shallow comparison for props and state.</p>

            <pre>
                    import React from 'react';

                    class PercentageStat extends React.PureComponent {

                        render() {
                        const { label, score = 0, total = Math.max(1, score) } = this.props;

                        return (
                            &lt;div&gt;
                            &lt;h6&gt;{label} &lt;/h6&gt; 
                            &lt;span&gt;{ Math.round(score / total * 100) }%&lt;/span&gt;
                            &lt;/div&gt;
                             )
                    }

                    }

                    export default PercentageStat;
                </pre>
            <div style="text-align: center;">

            <h3>What is Pure Component? When to use Pure Component over Component?</h3>
            <p><span><b>Ans:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></span>The second argument that can optionally be passed to setState is a
                callback function which gets called immediately after the setState is completed and the components get
                re-rendered.</p>

            <p>If you want your program to update the value of a state using setState and then perform certain actions
                on the updated value of state then you must specify those actions in a function which should be the
                second argument of the setState. If we would not do so then those actions will be performed on the
                previous value of state because of asynchronous nature of setState.</p>
